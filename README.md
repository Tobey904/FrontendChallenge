# üöÄ Frontend Internship Challenge üöÄ

This is a coding challenge to verify your knowledge in the beginning of your internship at B. Braun.
It is not a test of any kind, we just want to understand how you write code and solve problems. Based on that we can then together adjust an internship program to your individual needs.

Please don't expect to fulfill every requirement for the challenge. It possible you will simply not have the time for that, because of the internship schedule. Just use the time you have to create whatever you can.

You can pick your own experience level reflecting your technical skills. Feel free to mix up requirements from different experience levels if needed, to pick only ones suitable for you.
